# Love2D-Undertale
An UNDERTALE engine developed in LÃ–VE 11.5!</br></br>![A screenshot of the W.I.P battle engine](./github/images/screenshot.png "Screenshot of the W.I.P battle engine")</br></br>Current plan for this engine is to get the encounter engine finished. After that, maybe I'll do overworld and shop, too.
# Credits
[sawby](https://github.com/bradensMG) (me) for programming this engine</br>[bjornbytes](https://github.com/bjornbytes) (me) for developing [tick](https://github.com/bjornbytes/tick), a library this engine heavily relies on</br>[vrld](https://github.com/vrld) for developing [moonshine](https://github.com/vrld/moonshine), a library used by the engine to use shaders. None are used, but support is implemented so I thought I'd add this since the engine uses it.
